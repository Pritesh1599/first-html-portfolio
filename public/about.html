<p>My name is Pritesh Joshi, and I bring nearly two years of experience as a System Engineer at ATOS Global Pvt Ltd. 
  During this time, I've developed strong expertise in managing and optimizing IT infrastructures, including Linux, Windows, and SAP systems. 
  My work is driven by a commitment to proactive problem-solving and collaboration, ensuring systems run smoothly and clients remain satisfied. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Information Systems Management at the University of Galway, where I am expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity, data analytics, and IT project management. My technical skills in Python, C#, and SQL, combined with a passion for innovation, enable me to contribute effectively to any technology-focused team.
  I am also eager to develop new skills and am learning web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL.

<p> Outside of my professional life, I am an avid tech enthusiast who loves exploring the latest technological advancements and trends. 
  When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking, cycling, or simply exploring nature trails. 
  I also have a passion for cricket, which I find to be a great way to sharpen my strategic thinking skills. In addition to these activities, I enjoy experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, combining my love for creativity with my appreciation for good food. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and bring a fresh perspective to my work.</p>
